Approach to the model 
The vehicle counting system I built is made up of three main components: a detector, tracker and counter. The detector identifies 
vehicles in a given frame of video and returns a list of bounding boxes around the vehicles to the tracker. The tracker uses the
 bounding boxes to track the vehicles in subsequent frames. The detector is also used to update the trackers periodically to ensure 
that they are still tracking the vehicles correctly. The counter counts vehicles when they leave the frame or makes use of a counting 
line drawn across a road. Algorithm Used here is BackgroundSubtractorMOG.


Why this model
Computer Vision (CV) had been on my list of things to learn for a long time so I decided to use the opportunity 
to learn it. A vehicle counting system, as you might have already inferred, is a system that counts vehicles on the road. 
Why would you want to build one? Why would you want to count vehicles on the road? Here are some reasons:
Traffic management and planning
Traffic Control
Parking


What other model you could have used for the same?
Their is no other answer as this seems to be the best possible model in my knowledge and if their is i would like to invest  
my time in that and learn that too.

Why your current model is better than other models?
First of all the code is not too long and it is written in such a manner that if someone invests some time in it he/she will be
able to learn it quick and easy. The model covers all the aspect that were required and performs very efficiently in counting 
the vehicles.
